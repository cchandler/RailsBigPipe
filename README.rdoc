= BigPipe inspired experiment

This is a Rails 3.0.7 project with me experimenting with implementing a BigPipe like workflow on the render path.

= My goals

I wanted to see what it would take with the current Rack-based Ruby server implementations to preemptively flush the socket and get the browser to start rendering content before the response was fully-buffered.  So far it appears to work well if I start Rails with rackup.  A good chunk of the ruby servers today buffer the response making it impossible to control within Rails.  It looks like a lot of this is being solved in Rails 3.1.
